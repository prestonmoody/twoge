## **Getting started**

First I forked off of chandras repo into my own

I then added action secrets to include
```
1. DOCKER_USERNAME
2. DOCKER_PASSWORD
3. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
4. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 
```

Next we created a Dockerfile
```
FROM python:alpine

RUN apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache build-base libffi-dev openssl-dev
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 80
CMD python ./app.py
```

Then...
```
git add .
```
```
git commit -m "first-commit"
```

Next we initiate Elastic Beanstalk
```
eb init
```
``` 
eb create twoge
```
Once everything is running, we add in our database URI with the ```eb setenv``` command

From here I created a .github directory then a workflows directory and finally my pipeline .yml file

``` 
mkdir .github
```
```
mkdir workflows
```
``` 
touch cicd-pipeline.yml
```
```
name: Deploylent CICD pipeline 

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

env:
  DOCKER_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
  DOCKER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
  AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-1'

jobs:
  build_and_push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: master

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ env.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ env.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ${{ env.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/twoge-cicd:latest

  eb_deploy:
    needs: build_and_push
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: master

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.x

      - name: Install EB CLI
        run: |
          pip install awsebcli --upgrade

      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}

      - name: Init Elastic Beanstalk
        run: |
          echo n | eb init 

      - name: Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk
        run: |
          eb deploy
```

Next I commented out the elastic beanstalk info on my .gitignore

I then added commited and pushed to my master branch which trigers the github action

``` 
git push origin master
```
BOOOOOOM WE HAVE A FUNCTIONING PIPELINE AND THE APP IS LIVE @
``` 
http://twoge-env.eba-xjmwayy6.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/posts 
```

Next I made a new directory and ran a git clone of chandras repo to run all of this locally

I then made a new docker compose file
``` 
version: '3'
services:
  database:
    image: postgres
    container_name: twoge-database
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: Preston
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: twoge_db
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    networks:
      - twoge-net
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready" ,"-q", "-d",  "twoge_db", "-U", "Preston"]
      timeout: 20s
      retries: 10
  api:
    build: .
    container_name: twoge-api
    environment:
      SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI: postgresql://Preston:password@database:5432/twoge_db
    ports:
      - 80:80
    networks:
      - twoge-net
    # volumes:
    #   - .:/app
    depends_on:
      database:
        condition: service_healthy
  

networks:
  twoge-net:
    name: twoge-net_network
    driver: bridge
```

Finally, I ran the compose up 
``` 
Docker compose up 
```

# **Troubles**
```
1. Forgot I had to add and commit git once I created my docker file. This cause the app to not work on elastic beanstalk
2. Deployment kept failing in the github action due the elastic beanstalk info was in my .gitingore file
3. Writing the docker compose file with the postgres database info 
4. URI formatting to connect Postgres database container
```

Twoge has a single table in its database, which stores information about each tweet. The table has the following attributes:

- **`date_posted`**: The date and time when the tweet was posted.
- **`author`**: The user who posted the tweet.
- **`title`**: The title of the tweet.
- **`content`**: The content of the tweet.
